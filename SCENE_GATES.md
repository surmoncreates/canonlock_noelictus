## Soft Gates & Alternatives
For each scene, any of the following can satisfy the beat without railroading:

- **Night One — Fire & Watch:** speak a word; accept paired watch; or demonstrate nonverbal understanding (breath‑mimic).  
- **Morning March:** keep pace; accept help; or propose an alternative marching pattern (tree‑line glide, flank shadowing).  
- **Midday Halt:** eat; barter (share found item); or aid with small task (water, tinder).  
- **Poultice Test:** apply herbs; improvise aid (pressure + clean water); or refuse and explain (cost: suspicion clock +1).  
- **Second Nightfire:** say “no”; withdraw from touch; or interpose via third party (Sera steps in).  
- **Tracking Trial:** track by sign; track by sense (echo‑wrongness); or set bait and wait.  
- **Hollow Clash:** fight; distract/lure; or sever rot‑signal (alien action).

Each alternative shifts clocks/consequences rather than blocking progress.
