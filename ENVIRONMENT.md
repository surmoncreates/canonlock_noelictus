# ENVIRONMENT — Noëlictus Signals

- Echo mimicry (late): camp/forest sounds repeat a heartbeat after they occur.
- Resin fire hiss: pine resin pops sharply; used as mood & watch noise.
- Rot scent warning: air thickens sweet-sour before undead presence.
- Ground sign: gouges and disrupted loam carry “wrongness” Nyx can sense.
