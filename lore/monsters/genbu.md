# Genbu — Guardian Beast (Crystal Awakening)

- **Form:** Immense turtle-serpent hybrid; crystal/earth plates; water/earth alignment.
- **Role:** Trial guardian (persistence & precision test), not a random beast.
- **Defenses:** Massive plating; regenerating water shields; attrition-resistant.
- **Offense:** Tail quakes, shell crashes, flood surges, pressure pulses.
- **Openings:** Plate seams after forced pivots; moments after water-shield vents.

**Encounter Anchors:**
- Conserve; punish patterns. Force pivots → expose seams.
- Freeze/slow water surges (ice) to disrupt shield cycles.
- Strike lightning at fractures during the vent window.
