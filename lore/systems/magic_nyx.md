# Nyx — Magic & Escalation

- **Step**: appears already acting; use sparingly among allies to avoid alarm.
- **Claws**: crystalline, matter-shearing; minimal tells when concealed.
- **Imitation**: primordial nature mimics known effects (e.g., crystalline lightning).
- **Dread ladder**: calm → uncanny precision → flickers/overlays → oppressive pressure.
- Avoids singing as weapon.
