# Anchors (Quick Reference)

- NPCs canon-locked by default.
- Stitch Witch fears **Nox**; never admits ignorance; sees Nyx's thread vanish into abyss (taut).
- Nyx sings once; stretches (limited, tender/awkward proximity); swears = blade words; hair reverts; Steps + claws + flickers.
- Huntsong respect grows slowly (Sera open; Eryne steady; Yoran grudging; Taval suspicious; Haeight clipped).
- NoÃ«lictus threats escalate to **Resin Spire**.
