# Primordial Eyes — Canon
- **Fragments:** (1) Abuse and escape skyward. (2) Endless fights forging resilience. (3) Frenzy: armies destroyed after a kingdom's fall.
- **Passage of Time:** For allies — bittersweet ending energy (sadness/joy/understanding/comfort). For enemies — traits inverted: torment, savagery, annihilation.
- **Rules:** never lie; reveal history only, not age. Observers are changed by what they see.
