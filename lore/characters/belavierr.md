# Belavierr (Stitch Witch)

- Sees beings as **threads** and their connections as stitches.
- **Nyx's thread**: extends, then vanishes into abyss; still taut—held by something beyond her loom. Untraceable.
- Names bind; fears **Nox**. Never admits ignorance.
- Walked **Meshi**; predicted its fall. Accepts endings.
- Avoids direct conflict with Nyx. (Foreshadow) Will secretly tug Nyx’s abyss-thread later; it pulls back; she severs and hides it.
