# Nyx

- **Singer**; inherited resonance (Nox). Won’t use singing as a weapon by default.
- **Song**: perfect pitch; undertone of loss/longing; performed once (camp).
- **Combat**: disciplined feral fluidity; **Quantum/Euclidean Step**; empowered claws (matter-shearing);
  shadow-box/flicker overlays as pressure rises; slips bindings.
- **Escalation**: martial → dread (uncanny precision, flickers) → primordial (alien effects) → celestial (rare).
- **Habits**: stretches (limited; proximity gag), collects swears (blade words), resin ingestion → pukes (**Sera hair duty**).
- **Hair**: reverts to original length if cut (unspoken Huntsong lore).
- **Speech**: adapts fast; crisp tactical callouts.
