# Team — Hane, Aldis, Nieve (Crystal Awakening Trio)

- **Hane** — Wind affinity; high mobility; flanking/disruption.
- **Aldis** — Lightning affinity; burst damage; timing-sensitive execution.
- **Nieve** — Ice affinity; control, slows, water shaping and lockdown.

**Formation vs. Genbu:**
- Nieve suppresses water surges and slows limbs.
- Hane forces pivots/exposes seams with wind pressure.
- Aldis times lightning on exposed fractures immediately after shield vents.
- Trial philosophy: endurance + coordination; precision over brute force.
