# CANONLOCK_RULES — Noëlictus Arc

- Use latest canonlock style and anchors by default.
- Veterans (Lorn, Maev, Orren) are **not** present on this trip.
- Haeight is established hunter, not commander, not conscript.
- Darran (male conscript) persists as antagonist; escalates if unchecked.
- Sera (young hunter) is present as a foil; not cruel by default.
- Nyx’s speech: broken; simple words first (“Real”, “Hello”, “No”, name “Nyx”).
- Presence flags govern who can act in scenes; offstage influences appear only in dialogue/memory.
- BTS hooks may trigger without on-screen presence (e.g., Sera leaves water).
